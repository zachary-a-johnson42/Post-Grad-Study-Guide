# Basic HTML/CSS/JS

### HTML
>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.

### CSS
>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
>>Intro from MDN. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS

### JavaScript
>JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
>>There's a lot of terms to describe JavaScript, that will be covered later. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript

### Semantic markup
>Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring your HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) so that it reinforces the semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance. In a broader sense, it means that your site architecture separates presentation from content; essentially saying that HTML is used for structure and CSS is used for the style of your web design.
